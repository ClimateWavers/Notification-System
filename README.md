## Installation

cd climatewaver-notification-system

Install the required dependencies:

Configure the system and integrate it with your Django backend as described in the Configuration section.

Configuration
To configure the Notification System, make the following changes to your Django app:

1. Add 'channels' to Installed Apps
In your Django project's settings.py, add 'channels' to the INSTALLED_APPS list:
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other installed apps ...
    'channels',  # Add 'channels' to your installed apps
]

2. Configure Channel Layers
Set up channel layers in your settings.py. You can use the provided InMemoryChannelLayer for simplicity:

CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "channels.layers.InMemoryChannelLayer",
    },
}

3. Use Channels for Routing
In settings.py, set the ASGI_APPLICATION to your application's routing:

ASGI_APPLICATION = "climatewavers.routing.application"  # Use your project name

Usage
The ClimateWaver Notification System is now integrated with your Django app and ready to use. When specific events occur, you can trigger notifications to inform users in real-time.

For example, to notify users of new posts, you can trigger notifications when a new post is created. This can be done in your views or models where the relevant events take place.
